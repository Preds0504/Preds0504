 I’m @Preds0504 on github and my real name is Tyler
 I’m interested in coding (obviously) but my hobbies are things like play games, anime, working out, watching horror films, listening to metal, and watching stuff on YouTube
I am just trying to get adjusted to coding in general and getting used to using things like git bash and git hub

My professional email is tyhard1984@gmail.com
